	In The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of The Wild, there's this interesting effect where your character disintegrates when teleporting. Your character's body gets covered in this glowing blue texture. At the same time, these small blue strips start swirling out of your body and the texture on your body starts to split apart. Your body and the floating strands put a soft blue light areound you on the environment. Then eventually your character completely dissapears and only the floating strands are left. The camera pans upward to folloy the strands and then the screen fades to black.
	I'm guessing that the way it works is that the game first loads some sort of shader to repalce the texture on your body - the blue can't be a texture since it always seems to be in motion. After that when the blue on your body starts to fade, you cant see the actual character anymore, so the texture must have some sort of alpha value in a complicated math function to shape the strands that make you up now until they completely dissapear. The actual strands floating in the sky is proably a particle effect that produces a large amount of seperate strings. I really wonder how the math works since they look like they're moving independently rather than looking like they are moving parallel and stuck together as they rise.
	I like how even when trying to analyze it, it still looks pretty convincing how he seperates into pieces - you dont really see any obvious seams between the model and the floating particles. It also feels really light too as he just rises off the ground and floats into the sky into the wind. They did a really good job of just making the particles look like a stream of air - I mean, if you could see air.
