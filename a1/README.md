**Notes**
---
A: Shows a character bouncing around in a textured car, both lit by a spotlight  that moves back and forth rapidly (the sun) and ambient light. A large reflective cube rotates around showing the skybox and also gives off and additional spotlight.

B: I did a filter inspired by a game called MadWorld, which rounds off the worlds into 3 colors at any given time.

C: I stacked my rules off the given Game of Life program to see how much I could do while still somewhat using the original ruleset. The rules are all in the above link.

Misc: 
Markdown is at least *somewhat* evil.
